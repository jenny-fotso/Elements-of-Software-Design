# Elements-of-Software-Design
Assignments for the cs313e course.

"Learning Objectives:

In this course you will learn how to solve computational problems. Given a computational problem you should be able to

  Analyze (understand in detail) the problem
  Design an algorithm to solve the problem. In this design process you will choose the appropriate data                 structure and the most efficient algorithm
  Code the algorithm in Python 3
  Write your own test cases to test your algorithm. You will pay careful attention to edge cases.
  Make sure that the output matches the format as specified.

This is a programming intensive course."
